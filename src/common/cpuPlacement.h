// Where the emulator's threads run (KYTY_CPU_RESERVE).
//
// The command processor (CP) is the frame's critical path. In U54 its SMT sibling was busy 21.7% of
// the time, mostly with guest job threads, and a woken CP often waited for a CPU.
//
// KYTY_CPU_RESERVE=off (default): nothing changes.
// cp: the CP gets one physical core to itself, both logical processors, through Windows CPU sets
// (SetThreadSelectedCpuSets). Every other thread of the process keeps off that core through the
// process default CPU sets: guest threads, draw-prep workers, service and completion threads, the
// CP recorder, and driver threads alike.
// cp+recorder: the CP recorder thread (KYTY_CP_RECORDER=1) gets a second core the same way.
//
// Details:
// - The allowed processors are read at runtime: the process affinity mask (Process Lasso pins
//   Astro Bot to 0-15, the V-cache CCD) and any process default CPU sets.
// - Only whole cores, every logical processor allowed, are reserved. They are chosen in the last
//   level cache that holds most allowed processors, by SchedulingClass (the CPPC preference),
//   avoiding the core of logical processor 0 (interrupts). KYTY_CPU_RESERVE_CORE=<logical
//   processor> picks the CP's core instead.
// - Reservation is skipped (and logged) when fewer than 6 logical processors would remain.
// - A monitor thread re-applies the layout when the process affinity changes (Process Lasso sets it
//   after the process has started), checking once a second.
// - CPU sets never override a hard thread affinity (SetThreadAffinityMask). Kyty sets none: guest
//   pthread affinities are only stored. The monitor scans the process's threads every 5 s for one
//   anyway (drivers, overlays): a hard affinity that meets the general processors is already
//   narrowed to them by the CPU sets; one confined to the reserved cores runs there regardless.
//   KYTY_CPU_RESERVE_REPIN=1 moves such threads to the general processors (default: counted and
//   logged only).
//
// KYTY_CPU_SETS=<logical processors of group 0> (default unset: no restriction), e.g. 16-31 or
// 0-7,16-23: every thread of the process runs on these processors (within the affinity mask),
// through the process default CPU sets, a soft affinity. With KYTY_CPU_RESERVE the CP's core is
// chosen among them and the other threads get the rest of them. Unlike a process affinity mask,
// Process Lasso's affinity rule does not reset it.
// KYTY_CPU_RESERVE_REASSERT=1 (default off): the monitor also checks once a second whether another
// process replaced the process default CPU sets this module applied, and applies its layout again.
// Process Lasso's CPU-set rule (SetProcessDefaultCpuSets, about 0.6 s after the process starts)
// otherwise silently undoes KYTY_CPU_RESERVE and KYTY_CPU_SETS for every thread but the CP and the
// recorder: they keep their thread-selected sets, so the CP stays confined to its core while other
// threads run there again. Without KYTY_CPU_SETS the other process's sets become the constraint the
// layout is computed in (Process Lasso's (0-31) leaves it unchanged).
//
// KYTY_VCACHE_PLACEMENT=auto|0|1 (default auto): dual-CCD X3D processors (7950X3D, 7900X3D,
// 9950X3D, ...; one CCD has 3D V-cache) without a Process Lasso-like rule.
// - The V-cache CCD is the L3 cache group that measures largest (GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx
//   cache relations), not the one with most cores or the lowest index. A chip counts as dual-CCD X3D
//   only when there are two or more L3 groups and the largest is at least 1.5 times every other
//   (96 against 32 MiB). One L3 (7800X3D, 9800X3D, Intel hybrid) or equal L3s (7950X): no change.
// - auto: only when no external CPU-set or affinity rule is active: the process affinity mask is
//   the whole system's, no process default CPU sets were set before startup, KYTY_CPU_SETS is
//   unset, and no other process replaces the process default CPU sets later. When one appears
//   (Process Lasso applies its rule about 0.6 s after the process starts) the placement is dropped
//   for good and the KYTY_CPU_RESERVE behaviour without it applies. 1: also with an external rule
//   (still inside the process affinity mask). 0: off.
// - Hot threads keep to the V-cache CCD through the process default CPU sets: guest threads (the
//   guest pthreads inherit them), the main guest thread, the CP, the recorder, draw-prep workers,
//   service, completion and present threads, and driver threads. KYTY_CPU_RESERVE's cores are taken
//   inside the V-cache CCD. Cold threads (PlaceCurrentThreadCold: shader and pipeline compile
//   workers, pipeline journal/cache savers, file I/O, audio3d playback, diagnostics and monitors)
//   get the other CCD through their thread-selected CPU sets.
// - KYTY_VCACHE_GUEST=all (default): guest threads (PlaceCurrentThreadGuest) run on every allowed
//   processor outside the reserved cores, both CCDs, through their thread-selected CPU sets.
//   hot: only the hot processors (int19.3-int20); cold: only the other CCD. With hot, Astro Bot's
//   threads got 14 logical processors and its Draw Geometry thread fell behind (Bug C).
// - One "Kyty V-cache placement" line logs the decision at startup and whenever it changes.
//
// Placement samples, with the profiler's aggregates, the hang trace or
// KYTY_CPU_PLACEMENT_SAMPLES=1: the CP, the recorder, guest threads, draw-prep workers and service
// threads note where they run.
// - FrameEvents: CpuPlacement{Cp,Guest,Host}Samples; CpuPlacementCpOffCore and
//   CpuPlacementRecorderOffCore (outside their reserved cores); CpuPlacement{Guest,Host}OnCpCore
//   (on the physical core of the CP's latest sample: SMT sharing); CpuPlacementHardAffinity
//   (threads found with a hard affinity other than the process's), CpuPlacementHardAffinityReserved
//   (of those, confined to reserved cores), CpuPlacementRepinned.
// - Hang trace: placement.csv, samples per role and logical processor each second.
